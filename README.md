# Iris-Classification-Analytics

# Aim :

Analysis and Exploring Iris dataset based on 4 features for categorizing different species of Iris flower.

# Objectives:

This Project is thorugh application of machine learning with python programming.
It focuses on IRIS flower classification using Machine Learning with scikit tools.
Here some of algorithm are used that are some types of machine learning subparts algorithms of supervised and Unsupervised learning.
We are making accuracy and prediction in Iris project through Iris Dataset. This is easy and understable for machine learning stater.

# Methodology:

Data collection: I have collected the iris dataset from Kaggle.

Data Cleaning: In this step we prepare the data for further analysis by removing null values, transforming and standardizing our data.

Exploratory Data Analyis: After cleaning process we study the descriptive statistics, visualize data based on how they are related to each other.

Model Development: In this vary stage we undergo the use of machine learning algorithm to model.

Evaluation: After model development we check the Confusion metrics and also checks for the accuracy which produces more accurate results.

# Tools and Technologies:

Python3

Machine Learning

Jupyter notebook

Python libraries(numpy,pandas,seaborn,matplotlib)

# Conclusion:
The interesting inferences from the dataset are listed below:

In the iris dataset there are 3 classes of iris flower:
Iris satosa
Iris-virginica
Iris-versicolor

In the iris dataset there are 4 features of iris flower:
SepalLengthCm
SepalWidthCm
PetalLengthCm
PetalWidthCm

The better accuracy has been obtained from Logistic Regression of about 95.55%.
